# Password Fraustrator üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Seski Potato


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Pavithra K S - SCMS School of Engineering and Technology

### Project Description
Password Frustrator is a ‚Äúlogin system‚Äù that never lets you in ‚Äî instead, it roasts you with absurd Malayalam insults and ridiculous memes. Every attempt gets a fresh GIF-powered punchline, turning password entry into pure comedy chaos.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Everyone‚Äôs fed up with password screens that actually let you in. But the real problem? Not getting enough hilarious insults and crazy GIFs while failing to log in! Password Frustrator fixes this by being the world‚Äôs sassiest login screen‚Äîit mocks you with funny Malayalam roasts and silly memes every single time, turning your password fails into pure comedy. Because who wants an easy login when you can have a good laugh instead?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
By replacing boring old logins with a parade of sarcastic Malayalam one‚Äëliners and ridiculous GIFs, Password Frustrator ensures you‚Äôll never actually get in ‚Äî but you‚Äôll get roasted, laughed at, and emotionally wrecked in style. Each wrong password is rewarded with meme‚Äëlevel chaos, making frustration the point of the system.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used

- Languages used- 1.HTML (Used to hold this glorius purpose of a mess together)
                  2.CSS (Used to make this webiste pretty enough to roast everyone)
                  3.Javascript (The magic to make sure your password never gets accepted) 
- Frameworks used- None! Cause Javascript is an independent girly 
- Libraries used- Absolutely none,this is 100% organic code,we dont need no dependencies here
- Tools Used- 1.Web Browser (cause nobody carries floppy disks anymore)
              2.VS Code (lowkey the main character of the project)
